**Overview of the project**
## **Project Overview: Design and Verification of a Finite State Machine**

### **1. Project Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to design a Finite State Machine (FSM) using Verilog or VHDL and to verify its functionality through comprehensive simulation and testing. The FSM will be implemented to perform a specific control task, such as managing a traffic light system or a simple counter or an odd parity or an even parity. The project includes:
- **Designing the FSM**: Define the FSM's states, transitions, inputs, and outputs.
- **Implementing the FSM**: Write the Verilog or VHDL code to describe the FSM.
- **Creating Testbenches**: Develop testbenches to validate the FSM's functionality.
- **Simulating and Verifying**: Use simulation tools to test the FSM and verify its correctness.

### **2. Project Scope**

- **FSM Design**: 
  - **Define States**: List all the states of the FSM.
  - **Determine Transitions**: Specify how the FSM transitions from one state to another based on inputs.
  - **Specify Inputs and Outputs**: Identify the inputs that affect state transitions and the outputs generated by the FSM.

- **Implementation**:
  - **Verilog or VHDL Coding**: Write the FSM's description using either Verilog or VHDL.
  - **State Transition Logic**: Implement the logic that determines state transitions.
  - **Output Logic**: Define how outputs are generated based on the current state.

- **Testbenches**:
  - **Write Testbenches**: Create testbenches to apply different inputs to the FSM and observe its responses.
  - **Coverage of Test Cases**: Ensure that testbenches cover all possible states and transitions, including edge cases.

- **Simulation and Verification**:
  - **Simulate the Design**: Use a VLSI simulation tool to run simulations of the FSM.
  - **Verify Correctness**: Check if the FSM transitions through states as expected and produces correct outputs.
  - **Analyze Results**: Review simulation results to confirm that the FSM meets the design specifications.

### **3. Tools and Technologies**

- **Design Tools**: VLSI design software such as Synopsys Design Compiler, Xilinx Vivado, or Intel Quartus.
- **Simulation Tools**: Simulation environments like ModelSim, XSIM, or VCS.
- **Programming Languages**: Verilog or VHDL for FSM design.

### **4. Deliverables**

- **FSM Design Files**: Verilog or VHDL code describing the FSM.
- **Testbench Files**: Testbenches written in Verilog or VHDL to verify the FSM.
- **Simulation Reports**: Documentation of simulation results and verification outcomes.

### **5. Expected Outcomes**

- **Functional FSM**: A working FSM that performs the desired control task.
- **Validated Design**: Verification that the FSM behaves correctly under all specified conditions.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Complete documentation including design files, testbenches, and simulation results.
